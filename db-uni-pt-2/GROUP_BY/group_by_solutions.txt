	SELECT COUNT(*) AS subs_num,YEAR(`students`.`enrolment_date`) AS year
	FROM `students`
	GROUP BY `year`;

-Solution for Problem 2

	SELECT COUNT(*) AS teacher_num,`teachers`.`office_address` AS street_office
	FROM `teachers`
	GROUP BY `teachers`.`office_address`;

	FROM `exam_student`
	GROUP BY `exam_id`;

-Solution for Problem 4

	SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_department_courses, `department_id`
