We repeat the previous exercise with JOIN key:

-Solution for Problem 1

	SELECT `students`.*, `degrees`.`name` as degree_course
	FROM `students`
	INNER JOIN `degrees`
	ON `students`.`degree_id`= `degrees`.`id`
	WHERE `degrees`.`name` LIKE "%Corso di Laurea in Economia%";

-Solution for Problem 2

	SELECT `degrees`.*,`departments`.`name`
	FROM `degrees`
	INNER JOIN `departments`
	ON `degrees`.`department_id` =  `departments`.`id`
	WHERE `degrees`.`level` LIKE "%Magistrale%" 
	AND `departments`.`name`LIKE "%Dipartimento di Neuroscienze%";

-Solution for Problem 3

	SELECT `teachers`.*, `courses`.`name`
	FROM `teachers`
	JOIN `course_teacher` ON `course_teacher`.`teacher_id` = `teachers`.`id`
	JOIN `courses` ON `courses`.`id` = `course_teacher`.`course_id`
	JOIN `degrees` ON `degrees`.`id` = `courses`.`degree_id`
	WHERE `course_teacher`.`teacher_id` = 44;

-Solution for Problem 4

	SELECT `students`.*, `degrees`.*, `departments`.*
	FROM `students`
	JOIN `degrees` ON `degrees`.`id` = `students`.`degree_id`
	JOIN `departments` ON `degrees`.`department_id` = `departments`.`id`
	ORDER BY `students`.`surname`, `students`.`name`;

-Solution for Problem 5

	SELECT `degrees`.`name` AS degree_course, `teachers`.`name` AS teacher_name, `teachers`.`surname` AS teachers_surname,`courses`.`name` AS course_name
	FROM `teachers`
	JOIN `course_teacher` ON `course_teacher`.`teacher_id` = `teachers`.`id`
	JOIN `courses` ON `courses`.`id` = `course_teacher`.`course_id`
	JOIN `degrees` ON `degrees`.`id` = `courses`.`degree_id`;

-Solution for Problem 6

	SELECT DISTINCT `teachers`.`name` AS teacher_name,`teachers`.`surname` AS teacher_surname, `departments`.`name` AS department_name
	FROM `teachers`
	JOIN `course_teacher` ON `course_teacher`.`teacher_id`=`teachers`.`id`
	JOIN `courses` ON `courses`.`id`=`course_teacher`.`course_id`
	JOIN `degrees` ON `degrees`.`id`= `courses`.`degree_id`
	JOIN `departments` ON `departments`.`id` = `degrees`.`department_id`
	WHERE `departments`.`name` LIKE '%Dipartimento di Matematica%';

-Solution for Problem 7 (bonus)

	SELECT COUNT(`exam_student`.`vote`) as `exam_tries`, `courses`.`name` as course_name,`students`.`surname` as students_surname, `students`.`name` as students_name
	FROM `exam_student`
	JOIN `students` ON `students`.`id` = `exam_student`.`student_id`
	JOIN `exams` ON `exams`.`id` = `exam_student`.`exam_id`
	JOIN `courses` ON `courses`.`id` = `exams`.`course_id`
	WHERE `exam_student`.`vote` < 18
	GROUP BY `exams`.`course_id`,`course_name`,`students_surname`, `students_name`  
	ORDER BY `students_name`, `students_surname` ASC;
